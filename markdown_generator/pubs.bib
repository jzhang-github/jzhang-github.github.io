In this study, taking layered perovskite oxide thin films as the model system, it is demonstrated that the OER pathway can be effectively shifted by activating lattice oxygen, leading to strongly enhanced intrinsic activity. The OER performance of Ruddlesden-Popper (RP)-phase cobaltite is significantly enhanced as Sr doping at the A site increases, which is attributed to the shift of the reaction pathway from adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM). Advanced spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory calculations reveal that the Sr dopant effectively facilitates oxygen ligand hole formation, charge transfer from the oxygen sites, and the formation and migration of oxygen vacancy, hence promoting lattice oxygen to participate in surface reactions. The results provide critical insight into the role of oxygen activity and offer a potential way for constructing highly active electrocatalysts.},

However, the dynamic interfacial interactions of band-gap funneling in MA3 Bi2 Cl9-x Ix perovskites in the photoelectrochemical (PEC) system remain ambiguous. In light of this, we prepared single- and mixed-halide lead-free bismuth-based hybrid perovskites-MA3 Bi2 Cl9-y Iy and MA3 Bi2 I9 (named MBCl-I and MBI)-in the presence and absence of the band-gap funnel structure, respectively. Using temperature-dependent transient photoluminescence and electrochemical voltammetric techniques, we therefore confirmed the photophysical and (photo)electrochemical phenomena of solid-solid and solid-liquid interfaces for MBCl-I and MBI halide perovskites. Concerning the mixed-halide hybrid perovskites MBCl-I with a band-gap funnel structure, stronger electronic coupling arising from an enhanced overlap of electronic wavefunctions results in more efficient exciton transport. Besides, MBCl-I's effective diffusion coefficient and electron transfer rate demonstrate efficient heterogeneous charge transfer at the solid-liquid interface, generating improved photoelectrochemical hydrogen production. Consequently, this combination of photophysical and electrochemical techniques opens up an avenue to explore the intrinsic and interfacial properties of semiconductor materials for elucidating the correlation between material characterisation and device performance.

Sluggish diffusion, one of the core effects responsible for their exotic properties, has been intensively debated. Here, we demonstrate that a combination of machine learning (ML) and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) can uncover the complicated links between the rough potential energy landscape (PEL) and atomic transport in HEAs. The ML model accurately represents the local environment dependence of PEL, and the developed ML-kMC allows us to reach the timescale required to reveal how composition-dependent PEL governs self-diffusion in HEAs. We further delineate a species-resolved analytical diffusion model that can capture essential features of self-diffusion in arbitrary alloy composition and temperature in HEAs. This work elucidates the governing mechanism for sluggish diffusion in HEAs, which enables efficient and accurate manipulation of diffusion properties in HEAs by tailoring alloy composition and corresponding PEL.},

The changes in microstructures under irradiation are influenced by the primary damage state and the diffusion and interaction of defects over a prolonged period, presenting a problem that spans several scales. In this work, we present a multiscale modeling of defect evolution in body-centered cubic (BCC) MPEAs by combining molecular dynamics (MD) and cluster dynamics (CD) for the first time, which enables us to link the microscopic scale defect process with the experimentally observable defect structures at a mesoscopic scale and to analyze the critical factors affecting the irradiation performance of MPEAs. In contrary to previous reports on face-centered cubic (FCC) MPEAs, our MD simulations show that the random arrangement of different elements in MPEAs strongly suppresses intra-cascade cluster formation, even compared with their corresponding averaged alloy models (AAM). We then utilize the primary damage states from MD simulations to feed into a CD model and show that cluster growth in random MPEAs is inhibited during the reaction-diffusion stage due to the slower and three-dimensional defect dynamics compared with their corresponding AAMs. Our results elucidate the unique irradiation resistance mechanism of BCC MPEAs and provide essential guidelines for alloy design with controllable defect dynamics.},

It has been reported that the irradiation tolerance of MPEAs originates from the long-term defect evolution stage rather than the ballistic collision phase. However, understanding the long-term evolution of MPEAs is exceptionally challenging due to intrinsic chemical disorder. In this work, we apply atomistically-informed cluster dynamics to study defect evolution in MPEAs for the first time, which enables us to elucidate the critical features responsible for the irradiation performance of MPEAs. With suitable irradiation parameters, our obtained cluster size distributions are in good agreement with experiments. We further discuss the influences of defect migration energy heterogeneity, cluster geometry, and temperature on the produced defect cluster forms. Our results suggest that the small clusters during the collision phase in MPEAs suppress the formation of large-sized defect clusters in the long term. Contrary to the common belief, a broader migration energy distribution due to chemical disorder cannot reduce the maximal defect cluster size but increase the proportion of small clusters. Our results thus reveal that the major role of chemical complexity in MPEAs is to modify the growth mechanism of clusters by promoting small cluster formation and suppressing overall defect diffusivities.},

Morphing perovskites into specific shapes and geometries without damaging their intrinsic functional properties is attractive for designing devices and manufacturing. However, inorganic semiconductors are often intrinsically brittle at room temperature, except for some recently reported layered or van der Waals semiconductors. Here, by in situ compression, we demonstrate that single-crystal CsPbX3 micropillars can be substantially morphed into distinct shapes (cubic, L and Z shapes, rectangular arches and so on) without localized cleavage or cracks. Such exceptional plasticity is enabled by successive slips of partial dislocations on multiple \$\${\textbackslash}\{110{\textbackslash}\}{\textbackslash}langle 1{\textbackslash}bar\{1\}0 {\textbackslash}rangle\$\$systems, as evidenced by atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy and first-principles and atomistic simulations. The optoelectronic performance and bandgap of the devices were unchanged.

Built upon attributes of HECCs and their constituent precursors, our ML models demonstrate a high prediction accuracy (0.982). Using the well-trained ML models, we evaluate the single-phase probability of 90 HECCs that are not experimentally reported so far. Several of these predictions are validated by our experiments. We further establish the phase diagrams for non-equiatomic HECCs spanning the whole composition space by which the single-phase regime can be easily identified. Our ML models can predict both equiatomic and non-equiatomic HECs based solely on the chemical descriptors of constituent transition-metal-carbide precursors, which paves the way for the high-throughput design of HECCs with superior properties.},

After in-situ reconstruction, we obtain Ni@Co heterostructure composed of Ni hydroxide nanosheets and CoOx clusters, which exhibits outstanding electrochemical glucose sensing performance. Combining synchrotron-based X-ray adsorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman Spectroscopy, intermittent electrochemical measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we find that the presence of surface CoOx not only lowers the valence state of Ni, but also facilitates the deprotonation of Ni(OH)2 to form NiOOH active species for glucose oxidation.

	abstract = {Developing ceramic coating with high hydrogen isotopes permeation resistance is an urgent task in many fields such as fusion reactor systems, hydrogen storage/transportation, and fuel cell. In this work, a (TiVAlCrZr)O multi-component metal oxide glass (MCMOG) coating is developed as a new type of hydrogen isotopes permeation barrier (HIPB), and the diffusion behavior of deuterium in MCMOG is studied for the first time. Compared with the deuterium permeation reduction factor (DPRF) of 51 for amorphous alumina coating (at 587 °C in 0.65 µm), the 29 nm dense MCMOG coating has around 27 times enhancement with DPRF of 1420 at 550 °C. Based on first-principles calculations, we show that the significantly suppressed deuterium permeation in MCMOGs is attributed to the sluggish diffusion of deuterium arising from the highly rugged energy landscape, which is induced by the diversity of electronic band structures near the Fermi level. In addition, oxygen vacancies strongly affect PRF, where the PRF of the fully oxidized MCMOG layer (29 nm) is around 200 times compared to that of MCMOG with the same thickness containing oxygen vacancies. Therefore, dense MCMOG is a new promising HIPB material.},

	abstract = {Ordered L12 γ′ Ni3Al intermetallics are essential strengthening components to maintain the high strength of Ni-based superalloys and recently developed high entropy alloys at elevated temperatures. Under service conditions, structural disorder is usually encountered in these intermetallics, resulting in significant loss of their strengthening functionality. Thus, retaining the degree of order of the L12 intermetallics is vital for their long-term reliability and serviceability. In this study, atomistic simulations and rate equation analysis are employed to highlight a notable enhancement in the reordering ability of L12 intermetallics by incorporating multiple principal elements. Specifically, we examine the effects of Co and Ti addition on the irradiation-induced disordering and kinetic reordering process of L12 intermetallics. Our results reveal that the incorporation of Ti in the Al sublattice can maintain comparable disordering resistance as Ni3Al. Better yet, the introduction of Ti or Co fosters vacancy migration, which accelerates the kinetic reordering rate during the defect diffusion stage. A synergistic effect of Ti and Co in promoting kinetic reordering is also observed. Our work thus suggests a promising approach for designing irradiation-resistant multicomponent intermetallics, which can retain a high degree of structural order under irradiation with chemical disorder contributed by desirable compositions.},

	abstract = {Elemental segregation around extended defects is common in high-entropy alloys (HEAs) composed of multi-principal elements, which profoundly impacts their mechanical properties. In HEAs, the driving force for segregation usually competes with chemical short-range ordering (CSRO) formation, making it challenging to elucidate the segregation mechanisms. In this study, we systematically investigate the chemical composition changes around extended defects, including dislocations, stacking faults, and grain boundaries (GBs) in CoNiCrFe HEAs, to explore the chemical-structure-mechanical relationship utilizing hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamic (MC/MD) simulations and theoretical analysis. We find a pronounced Cr enrichment and Co/Ni/Fe depletion around all defects considered in this work. A correlation between the degree of structural disorder and the chemical segregation/depletion phenomenon in the proximity of extended defects has been uncovered. Our results show that due to the extreme chemical complexity in HEAs, CSRO inevitably contributes to the elemental rearrangement and affects segregation. Consequently, the segregation behavior in HEAs is mainly controlled by interactions between different atomic pairs, and the segregation entropy also plays a dominant role. By decoupling the strengthening contribution from elemental segregation and CSRO, we demonstrate and highlight that the strengthening in HEAs can be modulated by elemental segregation. The positive impact of element segregation on interfacial properties - improved ultimate tensile strength and elongation, has been evidenced through experimental comparisons of CoNiCrFe with different Fe additions. This work elucidates the mechanism of heterogenous elemental distributions in HEAs where elemental segregation and CSRO coexist, paving the way for manipulating their mechanical properties by modulating the compositional variations.},

	abstract = {As a newly emerged class of materials, chemically complex intermetallic alloys (CCIMAs) with exceptional thermal and mechanical properties are a promising candidate for high-temperature structural use. However, serious intergranular embrittlement at intermediate temperatures (600∼800 °C) is frequently found in those CCIMAs, obstructing their large-scale engineering applications. In this study, through deliberately tailoring thermomechanical processing, we designed a lamellar-structured (LS) L12-type Co-Ni-Al-Ti-Ta-Nb-B-based CCIMA that effectively overcomes this critical issue. The LS-CCIMA exhibits an excellent yield strength (YS) of ∼1.0 GPa with a large tensile elongation of ∼17\% at room temperature. More prominently, it also presents an anomalous YS of ∼1.2 GPa combined with an acceptable tensile elongation of ∼10\% at intermediate temperatures ranging from 600 to 800 °C, outperforming those of many other simple ordered intermetallics and conventional superalloys. Such superb immediate-temperature strengths primarily originate from the high anti-phase boundary energy caused by the addition of multiple alloying elements (Ti, Ta, and Nb) and the pile-ups of geometrically necessary dislocations. Moreover, we attribute the acceptable tensile plasticity to the increased plastic deformation capacities from the activation of various deformation-induced substructures (e.g., dislocation pairs at 600 °C and superlattice intrinsic stacking faults at 800 °C) and the inhibiting mechanisms of the lamellar structures on oxygen-induced grain boundary damage and microcrack's propagation. This work provides a new pathway for the innovative design of strong-yet-ductile heat-resistant CCIMAs.},

The compositional space of MTMCs is thoroughly explored by the well-trained model.

	abstract = {High-entropy materials have been proposed for applications in nuclear systems recently due to their outstanding properties in extreme environments. Chemical complexity in these materials plays an important role in irradiation tolerance since it significantly affects energy dissipation and defect behaviors under particle bombardment. Indeed, better resistance to irradiation-induced amorphization was observed in the high-entropy MAX (HE-MAX) phase (Ti, M)2SnC (M = V, Nb, Zr, Hf). However, in this work, we report an opposite trend in another series of HE-MAX phases (Ti, M)2AlC (M = Nb, Ta, V, Zr). It is demonstrated that the amorphization resistance is sequentially reduced as the number of components increases from single-component Ti2AlC to (TiNbTa)2AlC and (TiNbTaVZr)2AlC. These phenomena are verified through AIMD simulations and interpreted by analyzing the underlying properties combining lattice distortion and bonding characteristics through the first-principle calculation. By developing a machine-learning (ML) model, we can directly predict lattice distortion to screen HE-MAX phases with excellent resistance to irradiation-induced amorphization. We highlight that the elemental species plays a more crucial role in the irradiation tolerance of these MAX phases than the number of constituent elements. Knowledge gained from this study will enable an improved understanding of the irradiation tolerance in HE-MAX phases and other multi-elemental ceramics.},

The microstructure alterations induced by irradiation encompass defect generation, diffusion, and interaction over extended durations. Cluster dynamics (CD), a mesoscopic simulation method, has proved instrumental in studying the protracted evolution of microstructures. By solving the master equations that describe a series of cluster growth processes in CD models, we can facilitate the computation of physical quantities, including defect cluster size, number density, and volume fraction, thereby unveiling the mechanism governing cluster evolution. Stimulated by recently renewed interest in mesoscale simulations, this review examines critical factors in CD, such as cluster mobility, intra-cascade cluster formation, temperature, and radiation conditions, shedding light on their significant roles in shaping long-term cluster evolution. Furthermore, the application of CD models in modeling different irradiation effects on nuclear materials is expounded, encompassing irradiation-induced cluster nucleation and growth, precipitation, and swelling. Finally, we provide a summary of the limitations inherent in CD models and outline prospects for enhancing their effectiveness in elucidating the evolution mechanism of microstructures under irradiation conditions.},

	abstract = {Dislocation is a common structural feature in metallic alloys. Under irradiation, interactions between dislocations and irradiation-induced defects play a crucial role in governing various microstructural changes and the irradiation response of materials. Though such interaction has been intensively studied in elemental metals, little is known about it in concentrated solid solution alloys (CSAs). In this work, we study defect-dislocation interactions in NiFe CSAs through both elastic theory and atomistic simulations. Unexpectedly, we find that dislocations interact more strongly with defects in CSAs than in pure metals due to their higher elastic moduli, which is adverse to their irradiation performance based on conventional understanding. By comparing random models (Rand) and average atom models (Ave) for NiFe, we show that the random occupancy of atoms in the Rand model compared to the Ave model can reduce the interaction between dislocations and defects, thereby diminishing the dislocation bias factor. We further perform defect kinetic simulations and find that the complex energy landscape for defect motion in NiFe tends to restrict the movement of defects and weaken the ability of dislocations to absorb interstitials. Therefore, the chemical disorder in CSAs can partly reduce the defect-dislocation interaction strength thermodynamically and, more importantly, limit the movement of defects kinetically, both of which suppress the absorption ability of dislocations toward defects. Our integrated efforts shed light on the mechanisms governing defect-dislocation interactions in CSAs, providing insight into the reasons for the superior irradiation resistance of CSAs and offering possible directions to tune their irradiation performance.},

Recent studies have demonstrated that local chemical ordering (LCO) is an important structural feature in these alloys, which can significantly affect defect evolution. The presence of LCO leads to elemental rearrangement in CSAs and results in distinct interfaces separating the ordered and disordered phases. In this work, we study the role of LCO and order/disorder interface on defect evolution in NiFe CSAs. Our results indicate that the interface can act as defect sinks in the defect recombination stage. At the diffusion stage, defect evolution is strongly affected by LCO due to chemically biased diffusion in CSAs and preferential diffusion pathways of defect clusters. We further show that the degree of LCO and the dimensions of the LCO domains play significant roles in defect clustering and annihilation behavior. These results provide fundamental insight into the influence of LCO on defect evolution in CSAs and pave ways for designing highly irradiation-tolerant structural materials for nuclear applications.},
