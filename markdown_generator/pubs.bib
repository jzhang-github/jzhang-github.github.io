	abstract = {High-entropy ceramics (HECs) have shown great application potential under demanding conditions, such as high stresses and temperatures. However, the immense phase space poses great challenges for the rational design of new high-performance HECs. In this work, we develop machine-learning (ML) models to discover high-entropy ceramic carbides (HECCs). Built upon attributes of HECCs and their constituent precursors, our ML models demonstrate a high prediction accuracy (0.982). Using the well-trained ML models, we evaluate the single-phase probability of 90 HECCs that are not experimentally reported so far. Several of these predictions are validated by our experiments. We further establish the phase diagrams for non-equiatomic HECCs spanning the whole composition space by which the single-phase regime can be easily identified. Our ML models can predict both equiatomic and non-equiatomic HECs based solely on the chemical descriptors of constituent transition-metal-carbide precursors, which paves the way for the high-throughput design of HECCs with superior properties.},

	abstract = {Developing high-performance multicomponent ceramics, which are promising in solving challenges posed by emerging technologies, shows grand difficulties because of the immense compositional space and complex local distortions. In this work, an accurate machine learning (ML) model built upon an ab initio database is developed to predict the mechanical properties and structural distortions of multicomponent transition metal carbides (MTMCs). The compositional space of MTMCs is thoroughly explored by the well-trained model. Combined with electronic and geometrical analysis, we show that the elemental adaptability to the rock-salt structure elegantly elucidates the mechanical characteristics of MTMCs, and such adaptability can be quantified by local lattice distortions. We further establish new design principles for high-strength MTMCs, and V–Nb–Ta-based MTMCs are recommended, which are validated by the present experiments. The proposed model and design philosophy pave a broad avenue for the rational design of MTMCs with exceptional properties.},
