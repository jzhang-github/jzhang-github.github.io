	abstract = {Developing noble-metal free electrocatalysts with high sensitivity is critical for the large-scale application of electrochemical glucose sensors. This work reports an atomic-scale interfacial engineering strategy to construct highly-active electrocatalyst for glucose detection. Ni(OH)2 nanosheets are decorated with an ultra-thin layer of Co9S8 using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. After in-situ reconstruction, we obtain Ni@Co heterostructure composed of Ni hydroxide nanosheets and CoOx clusters, which exhibits outstanding electrochemical glucose sensing performance. Combining synchrotron-based X-ray adsorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman Spectroscopy, intermittent electrochemical measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we find that the presence of surface CoOx not only lowers the valence state of Ni, but also facilitates the deprotonation of Ni(OH)2 to form NiOOH active species for glucose oxidation. The approach used in this work can be adapted to synthesizing high-performance electrocatalysts for other energy and environmental devices.},

	abstract = {Developing ceramic coating with high hydrogen isotopes permeation resistance is an urgent task in many fields such as fusion reactor systems, hydrogen storage/transportation, and fuel cell. In this work, a (TiVAlCrZr)O multi-component metal oxide glass (MCMOG) coating is developed as a new type of hydrogen isotopes permeation barrier (HIPB), and the diffusion behavior of deuterium in MCMOG is studied for the first time. Compared with the deuterium permeation reduction factor (DPRF) of 51 for amorphous alumina coating (at 587 °C in 0.65 µm), the 29 nm dense MCMOG coating has around 27 times enhancement with DPRF of 1420 at 550 °C. Based on first-principles calculations, we show that the significantly suppressed deuterium permeation in MCMOGs is attributed to the sluggish diffusion of deuterium arising from the highly rugged energy landscape, which is induced by the diversity of electronic band structures near the Fermi level. In addition, oxygen vacancies strongly affect PRF, where the PRF of the fully oxidized MCMOG layer (29 nm) is around 200 times compared to that of MCMOG with the same thickness containing oxygen vacancies. Therefore, dense MCMOG is a new promising HIPB material.},
